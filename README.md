The aim of this project is to predict a patient's heart disease status (0 or 1), based on a variety of markers (personal and biological)

We will be using the Kaggle Heart Disease dataset, located: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease

For our ML models, we will explore:
- Logistic Regressoin
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest Classifiers
